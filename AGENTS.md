# AGENTS.md - Chaos Core Project Guide

## Project Overview

**Chaos Core** is a tactical RPG built with Tauri + TypeScript, featuring a card-based combat system with strain mechanics on a tactical grid battlefield. The game draws heavy inspiration from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance while incorporating unique deck-building and equipment customization systems.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Tauri 2.x (Rust backend + TypeScript frontend)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.x
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.6.2
- **UI**: Vanilla TypeScript with custom rendering
- **State Management**: Custom game store (`src/state/gameStore.ts`)

## Core Game Systems

### 1. Battle System (`src/core/battle.ts`)
- **Grid-based tactical combat** with customizable battlefield dimensions
- **Turn order system** based on unit AGI stats
- **Card-driven actions** - units play cards to perform actions
- **Strain mechanics** - cards accumulate strain with penalties for exceeding thresholds
- **Win/loss conditions** with rewards (Wad currency + crafting resources)

### 2. Card System (`src/core/cardHandler.ts`, `src/core/cardEffects.ts`)
- Each unit has: deck, draw pile, hand, discard pile
- **Card types**: Attack, Move, Defend, Overcharge, and more
- **Strain cost** per card - no limit on cards played per turn
- Cards are tied to equipment (weapons, armor, accessories)
- **Deck compilation**: Combines locked cards (from equipment) + slotted cards (player choice)

### 3. Equipment System (`src/core/equipment.ts`)
- **Five equipment slots per unit**: Weapon, Helmet, Chestpiece, Accessory1, Accessory2
- Weapons are class-restricted; other gear is universal
- Equipment provides both locked cards and free slots for customization
- **Modules**: Upgradeable components that add new cards to equipment

### 4. Gear Workbench (`src/core/gearWorkbench.ts`)
- **Card slotting system**: Slot cards from Card Library into equipment free slots
- **Card Library**: Global, persistent collection of all acquired cards
- **Deck compiler**: Generates final deck from locked + slotted cards
- **Compiling animation**: OS-themed visual feedback
- **.PAK system**: Loot packs that grant multiple cards

### 5. Inventory System (`src/core/inventory.ts`)
- **Three capacity types**: MASS (kg), BULK (bu), POWER (w)
- **Two zones**: Forward Locker (taken into runs) vs Base Camp Storage (infinite, safe)
- **Overcapacity penalties**:
  - MASS overload → AGI_DOWN debuff
  - BULK overload → JAM chance on attacks
  - POWER overload → Random POWER SURGE damage events
- **MULE System**: Upgrade weight classes (E → D → C → B → A → S)

### 6. Crafting System (`src/core/crafting.ts`, `src/core/workshop.ts`)
- **Workshop Node** in Base Camp
- **Recipe categories**: Weapons, Armor, Consumables
- **Four primary resources**:
  - Metal Scrap (mechanical enemies, destructible objects)
  - Wood (crates, free-move zones)
  - Chaos Shards (magical enemies, rare nodes)
  - Steam Components (mechanical weapons, minibosses)
- Recipes must be learned before use (found/bought, permanent)

### 7. Save System (`src/core/saveSystem.ts`)
- Rust Tauri commands: `save_game(json)`, `load_game()`
- Serialized GameState with autosave functionality
- Controller support with settings persistence

### 8. ScrollLink OS Theme
- **Boot sequence** (`ScrollLinkBoot.ts`): Logo, fake logs, loading bar
- **Shell interface** (`ScrollLinkShell.ts`): Status bar, main window, terminal panel
- **OS-themed transitions**: All screens treated as "apps" within the shell

## Key Data Structures

### GameState (`src/core/types.ts`)
```typescript
interface GameState {
  screen: string;
  operationId: string | null;
  currentFloorIndex: number;
  visitedRooms: RoomId[];
  currentRoomId: RoomId | null;
  battleState: BattleState | null;
  party: Unit[];
  resources: { wad, metalScrap, wood, chaosShards, steamComponents };
  forwardLocker: InventoryItem[];
  baseStorage: InventoryItem[];
  capacityLimits: { mass, bulk, power };
  cardLibrary: Record<CardId, number>;
  knownRecipes: RecipeId[];
  settings: GameSettings;
}
```

### Unit (`src/core/types.ts`)
```typescript
interface Unit {
  id: UnitId;
  name: string;
  isEnemy: boolean;
  hp: number;
  maxHp: number;
  agi: number;
  pos: { x: number; y: number } | null;
  hand: CardId[];
  drawPile: CardId[];
  discardPile: CardId[];
  strain: number;
  unitClass?: string;
  loadout?: {
    weapon: string | null;
    helmet: string | null;
    chestpiece: string | null;
    accessory1: string | null;
    accessory2: string | null;
  };
  buffs?: Array<{ type, amount, duration }>;
}
```

### Card (`src/core/types.ts`)
```typescript
interface Card {
  id: CardId;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  strainCost: number;
  targetType: "enemy" | "self" | "tile";
  range?: number;
  effects: CardEffect[];
}
```

## Aesthetic Guidelines

**"Ardycia Aesthetic Bible"** - See `Ardycia aesthetic bible.txt`

Key principles:
- Less "computer program", more "actual game"
- Retain ScrollLink terminal boot screen as flourish
- Battle grid should feel at-home for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance players
- Work within limitations before character portraits/art are implemented
- Temp art should still capture the tactical RPG feel

## Development Guidelines

### When Implementing Features
1. **Core logic first** - Implement in `src/core/` as pure functions
2. **State integration** - Wire up to `gameStore.ts`
3. **UI last** - Create screen in `src/ui/screens/`
4. **Maintain separation** - Keep game logic decoupled from UI rendering

### Code Organization
- **Pure functions** in `src/core/` should not depend on UI or DOM
- **State mutations** should go through the game store
- **Screen files** handle rendering and user interaction
- **Type definitions** belong in `src/core/types.ts`

### Testing Battle Changes
1. Start game → New Operation
2. Navigate to battle node on map
3. Test combat mechanics
4. Verify reward screen
5. Return to Base Camp

### Crafting & Equipment Testing
1. Base Camp → Workshop for crafting
2. Base Camp → Roster for loadout changes
3. Gear Workbench for card slotting
4. Verify deck compilation
5. Test in battle

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Card
1. Define card in equipment data or card library
2. Add effect handler in `src/core/cardEffects.ts`
3. Update card rendering in battle UI
4. Test in deck compilation

### Adding a New Equipment Piece
1. Add definition to `src/core/equipment.ts`
2. Specify locked cards and free slots
3. Add to loot tables or crafting recipes
4. Test in loadout screen

### Adding a New Crafting Recipe
1. Add to recipe definitions in `src/core/crafting.ts`
2. Specify resource requirements
3. Test in workshop UI

### Modifying Battle Mechanics
1. Update logic in `src/core/battle.ts`
2. Test turn order, damage calculations, etc.
3. Update battle screen rendering if needed
4. Verify AI behavior still works

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an active game development project with a detailed roadmap
- Implementation is currently at **Headline 12bza** (see README.txt)
- The project follows a strict separation between core logic and UI
- ScrollLink OS theming is a core aesthetic element
- Strain mechanics and deck-building are central to gameplay identity
- Equipment drives card availability (not standalone card collection)
- Inventory uses three-axis capacity system (MASS/BULK/POWER)
- All game screens operate within the ScrollLink shell interface
- Controller support is a first-class feature
- Save system uses Tauri's Rust backend for file I/O

## Quick Reference

**Start a battle**: Main Menu → New Operation → Operation Map → Battle Node
**Access crafting**: Base Camp → Workshop Node
**Modify loadout**: Base Camp → Roster Node → Unit → Equipment
**Customize gear**: Loadout Screen → Gear Workbench
**Manage inventory**: Base Camp → Inventory (Forward Locker ↔ Base Storage)
**Change settings**: Main Menu → Settings (or pause during gameplay)
