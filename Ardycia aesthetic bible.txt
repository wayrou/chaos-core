Aesthetic Bible
This includes definitions, core principles, visual examples, DO vs. DON'T rules, and pitfalls to avoid.
0. PURPOSE
Ardycia’s aesthetic is the foundation of Chaos Core, Elise is Alone, and all future connected works.
 This guide defines:
What Ardycia looks like


What Ardycia feels like


The visual logic behind cultures, tech, magic, OS systems, and character design


DO/DON’T rules to ensure all artists produce cohesive work


Think of this as the “visual grammar” of Ardycia.

1. CORE AESTHETIC PILLARS
Ardycia’s look emerges from six intersecting styles, all of which must coexist harmoniously:
Utilitycore / Adventure Gothic / Gear Punk


Steampunk Bronze vs. Industrial Futurism Decay


Atomic Autumn


Light Burton-Esque


Light Militarypunk


Retrofuture Noir


Scroll Link OS (Retro-Terminal Tech)


Each is broken down below with DO/DON’T rules.

2. UTILITYCORE / ADVENTURE GOTHIC / GEAR PUNK
“Everything has a use. Everything is weathered.”
Key Traits
Many straps, belts, loops, and modular attachments


Uneven distribution of gear


Leather, canvas, cloth, and weathered metal


Heavy boots, patched gloves, utilitarian layers


Medieval adventurer meets industrial mechanic



DO
✔ Give characters multiple locations to carry tools, weapons, or talismans
 ✔ Use worn materials: cracked leather, faded dyes, patched fabrics
 ✔ Let silhouettes feel asymmetrical and weight-bearing
 ✔ Show history in every item (scratches, dents, repairs)
DON’T
✘ Make characters look sleek, clean, or symmetrical
 ✘ Introduce modern tactical gear (plastic, hard polymers, SWAT-style vests)
 ✘ Use bright sci-fi neon or glossy chrome here—save that for OS/terminal tech
 ✘ Add straps or buckles purely for decoration — everything must function

3. STEAMPUNK BRONZE VS. INDUSTRIAL FUTURISM DECAY
“Two worlds: elegant new craft vs. haunted old machinery.”
Ardycia is shaped by the contrast between:
New World Tech: Brass, bronze, polished fittings, decorative rivets


Old World Tech: Dying magnets, rusted steel, peeling labels, cracked screens


Nature overgrows everything.

DO
✔ Pair new and old technology visibly (bronze gear on top of rusted machinery)
 ✔ Use warm metallic palettes for new inventions
 ✔ Show plants and moss claiming old industrial ruins
 ✔ Lean into welded plates, exposed wiring, gears partially fused with mineral deposits
DON’T
✘ Make steampunk gadgets too clean or pristine
 ✘ Depict old world tech as futuristic glossy sci-fi
 ✘ Use plastic, LED-era tech, or polished aluminum
 ✘ Overstuff scenes with gears—use selectively, not as decoration

4. ATOMIC AUTUMN
“Small-town warmth, industrial melancholy.”
Inspired by The Iron Giant, rust-belt Americana, retro Midwest charm.
Atmosphere
Warm autumn palettes (rust, pumpkin, faded red paint)


Mist, quiet streets, industrial hum


Cozy meets ominous



DO
✔ Show nostalgia and melancholy—railroads, water towers, barns, mills
 ✔ Use worn signage, cracked enamel, 50s-inspired design language
 ✔ Build environments with “comfort that has seen tragedy”
 ✔ Include falling leaves, fog, and golden-hour lighting
DON’T
✘ Make it whimsical or cartoony
 ✘ Use bright modern plastics or 70s neon tones
 ✘ Depict American patriotism (flags, logos) — this is Ardycia, not Earth
 ✘ Overdo the autumn leaves — subtlety > saturation

5. LIGHT BURTON-ESQUE
“Curves that feel eerie, not goofy.”
This influence should be very subtle.
Traits
Slightly crooked architecture


Elongated proportions


Whimsical imperfection


Carved wood and wrought iron



DO
✔ Tilt silhouettes by 2–5 degrees—barely noticeable
 ✔ Add curling patterns to lanterns, signposts, tree branches
 ✔ Use high-contrast lighting and rim glow
 ✔ Let environments feel storybook but grounded
DON’T
✘ Go full “Nightmare Before Christmas” exaggerated
 ✘ Use bright cartoon colors or comedic proportions
 ✘ Add googly eyes or comical Gothic tropes

6. LIGHT MILITARYPUNK
“Improvised paramilitary flavor, but still fantasy.”
Traits
Tactical straps and harnesses


Surplus-style military gear integrated into medieval clothing


Customized armor pieces


Practicality over ceremony



DO
✔ Give characters unique personal gear layouts
 ✔ Mix medieval armor plates with scavenged industrial parts
 ✔ Use natural cloth colors: olive, khaki, charcoal
 ✔ Emphasize field-readiness
DON’T
✘ Include modern firearms (unless ancient relics with unique designs)
 ✘ Use full tactical vests, MOLLE systems, synthetic hard armor
 ✘ Copy any real-world military fashion too closely
 ✘ Add modern camouflage patterns

7. RETROFUTURE NOIR
“Light against shadow. Mystery in the rain.”
Traits
Sharp silhouettes


High contrast


Rain, fog, reflective puddles


Backlit scenes


A sense of secrecy



DO
✔ Use silhouettes heavily when showing powerful figures
 ✔ Cast long shadows from machinery or terminals
 ✔ Blend light rain with reflective surfaces
 ✔ Keep palettes dark but not monotone
DON’T
✘ Make neon cities or Blade Runner knockoffs
 ✘ Use bright neon pinks/purples except sparingly in OS glows
 ✘ Go cyberpunk—this is noir, not neon dystopia

8. SCROLLLINK OS — RETRO-TERMINAL TECH
“A dying operating system with a soul.”
This is Ardycia’s unique tech identity. It must feel:
Retro


Arcane


Semi-sentient


Military-grade


Broken but magical


Visual Language
CRT glow, scanlines, phosphor smear


Military BIOS aesthetics


Glitching glyphs


Ghost text


Vector wireframes, tactical schematics


Terminal prompts such as:
 SLK> ENGAGE::NODE_04
 SLK> MEMORY_FRAG::REBUILD


UI is never modern. It's always analog-digital hybrid.

DO
✔ Use monochrome or duotone UI (teal, green, amber, violet)
 ✔ Add micro-glitches, flicker, jitter, ghosting
 ✔ Give UI shape language influenced by bronze-era design
 ✔ Include ASCII maps, wireframes, arc diagrams
 ✔ Treat OS logs like religious scripture or prophecy
DON’T
✘ Use modern flat UI, smartphone aesthetics, or web design motifs
 ✘ Introduce complex color gradients
 ✘ Overuse neon colors
 ✘ Add touch interfaces or holograms

9. ENVIRONMENTAL LANGUAGE
DO
✔ Mix nature and tech — vines through servers, moss on generators
 ✔ Use handmade repairs (twine, hammered plates, welded patches)
 ✔ Let light sources feel warm and analog (gas lamps, oil lanterns, CRT screens)
 ✔ Keep worlds sparse, not cluttered
DON’T
✘ Build shiny utopian cities
 ✘ Fill scenes with unnecessary props
 ✘ Use plastic-looking materials

10. CHARACTER DESIGN SUMMARY
The Ardycian Adventurer Must Look Like:
They’ve traveled far


They can’t afford to waste anything


They’re carrying their life on their back


Their gear has been repaired more times than manufactured


They’ve interacted with remnants of a technologically superior past

 ✔ Add subtle chromatic aberration to OS elements
 ✔ Use warm/cool contrast (autumn vs terminal glow)
DON’T
